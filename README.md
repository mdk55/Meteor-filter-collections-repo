prototype using meteor filter collections package and updated to meteor 1.3.4.4

this is a sample app from a previous sample app testing the flexibility and usage writes of the filter collections package. 

I did not get around to testing the query or sort via back-end and configuration segments so these are relatively untouched. Please also note that the filter buttons have been disabled since I was disecting the filters for a <select><options> style switchboard instead of what it recommends for datatables and column radioboxes.
